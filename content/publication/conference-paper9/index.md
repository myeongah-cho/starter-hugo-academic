abstract: The region proposal task is to generate a set of candidate regions that contain an object. In this task, it is most important to propose as many candidates of ground-truth as possible in a fixed number of proposals. In a typical image, however, there are too few hard negative examples compared to the vast number of easy negatives, so region proposal networks struggle to train on hard negatives. Because of this problem, networks tend to propose hard negatives as candidates, while failing to propose ground-truth candidates, which leads to poor performance. In this paper, we propose a Negative Region Proposal Network(nRPN) to improve Region Proposal Network(RPN). The nRPN learns from the RPNâ€™s false positives and provide hard negative examples to the RPN. Our proposed nRPN leads to a reduction in false positives and better RPN performance. An RPN trained with an nRPN achieves performance improvements on the PASCAL VOC 2007 dataset.
